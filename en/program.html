     <h3>Jonathan-David Schröder</h3>
      <p>G'MIC is a full-featured open-source software framework for digital image processing. Its C++ library has been developed within the french CNRS research-center for more than 10 years. We will be showcasing a work in progress on plugging as many as its parametric graphics 500 filters through a new official C/Python binding for data-scientists, artists and amateurs, as well as a new Blender3d/Python/Nodes add-on using the binding.

        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4"> Designing for/with CryptPad</h3>
        <h3>David Benqué</h3>
         <p>CryptPad is a collaborative office suite that is open source and encrypted. We aim to offer similar tools and features as the big platforms, but with privacy as a guiding principle. I will talk about the way we "get things done" as a core team of three. CryptPad is both the product we are developing and our daily work environment. As the designer on the team, operating from within the apps I am designing has led me to devise new strategies and workflows. I will reflect on these using a couple of recently added features as tangible examples. These include the option to "burn after reading", access rights management, and deleting a document's history. These features also illustrate some of the concepts and trade-offs that are unique to CryptPad and that we try to communicate through the interface. Finally, I will reflect on how UI/UX design work "gets done" not only *for* open source software, but *with* it. The FLOSS tools for this kind of work are still few and far between, but there are exciting things on the horizon.

        <h3> Brendan Howell</h3> 
        <p>In 2015 I was offered a job teaching a first-year foundations course in digital design. Bemused, I informed my future colleagues that I was 1. an artist/engineer and not a proper designer and 2. that I would teach the course strictly using FLOSS tools. Much to my surprise, I got the position and they happily accepted my conditions. Even more surprisingly, I am still working there 5 years later. In this presentation, I will outline the curriculum that I have developed for teaching digital design foundations. This course is specially conceived for, and indeed only possible, using FLOSS tools and approaches. I will of course provide some examples of successful workshops, assignments, projects (and a few interesting (or at least, comic) failures). Finally, I will try to sketch out some areas and forms of practice where FLOSS tools, instead of catching up, are starting to lead the way to new forms of education, knowledge and image making.

        <h3>Tobias Bernard</h3>
      <p>Over the past few years the way we do icons at GNOME has changed significantly: We have an overhauled style for app icons, a new approach to symbolic icons in apps, and a number of neat new little helper apps, all in the service of one goal: Making icons dramatically easier to deal with for third party app developers and designers. To enable these easier workflows we've come up with a number of unorthodox solutions that challenge some of the classic best practices of icon design, such as multiple icon sizes, pixel hinting, and the icon name specification. We'll talk about how this initiative came to be, where we are right now (with some live demos), and what's in store for the future.

      <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4">From 2D to 3D using Deep Learning</h3>
      <h3>Peter Naftaliev</h3>
    <p>Technological advances in artificial intelligence allow to take photos of real life objects and automatically create 3D models out of them. This is going to change the way a 3D designer works, allowing for much more efficiency and time saving. In this talk I will present a new neural network which takes as input a 2D image and automatically creates a 3D model, using an encoding-decoding architecture using Tensorflow. A ResNet based encoder is trained to encode the image into a z-vector with inherent 3D features and a decoder which is actually a boolean classifier is trained to create a 3D model from the z-vector. The reconstruction can happen in any voxel resolution, without retraining the network. We will also see how this same architecture combined with a generative adversarial network (GAN) can be used to generate new 3D models. We will discuss some of the challenges with 3D modelling and ML, we will present cool implementations of ML in the visualization, texture analysis, 3D modeling and other relevant subjects.</p>

      <h3>Eylul Dogruel</h3>
    <p>Processing is a java based programming language that is designed specifically for creatives, and is used commonly by artists, designers and makers. The workshop will start with a brief introduction to programming with processing, overviewing structures of the programming and the Processing language. We will then use the code as a painting and animation medium, and explore how the artist can both use code to generate the art or to collaborate with it. During the second half of the workshop participants will pursue their individual art projects based on their interests. The workshop is focused on creative process and as such open both to participants with or without prior experience in programming.

      <h3>Joāo Bueno</h3>
    <p>Terminedia is a project meant an easy to use tool to create innovative art with ASCII and Unicode characters meant for programmers and artists alike. Having a character cell as "Picture element" in a terminal, one as not only a color, as image pixels do, but the character itself (its shape), a background color, and text effects such as bold, underline and blinking. Terminedia is a Python library that allows "drawing with characters", selecting various attributes as size, color, direction and effects. This allows for the creation of static and interactive graphic art, business applications and even videogames (with complexity equivalent to games from the 8 bit era). Its drawing API, capable of doing ellipses, rectangles, bezier curves, blitting other images, using colors and gradients, can work with either 1/4 block characters - (▄ ▛ ▌ ▜ ▝ ▚ ▖ ▞ ▀ █ ▘▗ ▙ ▐ ▟), in the same way traditional images works - so that a 80x25 text terminal can display a 160x50 colored image, or just use plain characters. As an example, issuing the call "screen.draw.ellipse((0, 0, 40, 15), color=(255,255,0), effects = Effects.blink, char='@') " will draw an ellipse using "@"
